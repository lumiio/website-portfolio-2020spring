# Project 3: Website Portfolio

The home page is index.html. There is nothing too fnacy here, so just access the file directly. From there you can navigate to the various pages via the navbar. So far the only page that is completely done is the PC/Steam page. The Switch page has some assets that need to be replaced and the PS4 page is missing a better formatted logo.

The footer bar will be filled with a full credits list from Assets.md as well.
